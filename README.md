# My Learning Journey with Machine Learning Zoomcamp

## Module 1: Introduction to Machine Learning

The first part of the course helped me understand what machine learning is and how it’s different from just writing traditional programs. I learned about the whole process from collecting data to making predictions.

### What I Learned
- The basics of machine learning, like supervised and unsupervised learning  
- How to think about a problem from a business or real-world point of view  
- The steps involved in a machine learning project: gathering data, cleaning it, exploring it, building models, and checking how good they are  
- Setting up my environment in Python so I can do the work easily  
- Working with a dataset about car fuel efficiency to practice exploring and cleaning data  

> This module taught me that good data and understanding the problem are the most important parts before building anything.

## Module 2: Regression

In the second module, I focused on how to predict numbers, like the price of a car, using regression models. I applied what I learned with a project about estimating car prices.

### Main Things I Learned
- How to prepare data and find useful patterns  
- How to create a simple model called linear regression and understand the basics behind it  
- How to check how accurate my predictions are using a thing called RMSE (a way to measure errors)  
- How to improve my models by adding new features and fixing mistakes  
- Why regularization helps in making better models that work well on new data  
- How to test and tune my models to make them as good as possible  
- Building models in Python from scratch and also using helpful libraries  

> This part showed me that building good models isn’t just about coding , it’s about understanding the data and making small improvements step by step.

### Module 3: Classification
In the third module of the course, I learned how machine learning can be used to classify things—predicting categories such as "converted" leads or not. I worked with a real-world dataset about lead scoring for an online course and applied a step-by-step classification workflow, including data preparation, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, training models, and evaluating results.

### I Learned

- I checked for missing values in both categorical and numerical columns. I learned to fill missing values-categorical ones with 'NA', and numerical ones with 0.0 to make sure the data was ready for modeling.
- I practiced finding the most common value in a column (mode). I calculated the correlation matrix for all numeric features and identified which pairs of variables were most related.
- I split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets (60/20/20) to keep the evaluation fair and reproducible.
- I used label encoding for category columns when calculating mutual information, and one-hot encoding when training my models.
- I measured how much information each categorical variable shares with the target label, showing which categories help the model the most.
- I trained a logistic regression model to classify converted leads and experimented with regularization strength (the 'C' parameter) to make my model generalize better.
-  I learned how to measure the importance of each feature by removing them one at a time and observing the change in model performance.

### Reflection
This module helped me understand how classification models are built and what steps matter most: preparing good data, exploring and choosing features, and tuning the model carefully. I got hands-on experience with real-world problems and built confidence in using scikit-learn for practical machine learning tasks.
