# My Learning Journey with Machine Learning Zoomcamp

## Module 1: Introduction to Machine Learning

The first part of the course helped me understand what machine learning is and how it’s different from just writing traditional programs. I learned about the whole process from collecting data to making predictions.

### What I Learned
- The basics of machine learning, like supervised and unsupervised learning  
- How to think about a problem from a business or real-world point of view  
- The steps involved in a machine learning project: gathering data, cleaning it, exploring it, building models, and checking how good they are  
- Setting up my environment in Python so I can do the work easily  
- Working with a dataset about car fuel efficiency to practice exploring and cleaning data  

> This module taught me that good data and understanding the problem are the most important parts before building anything.

## Module 2: Regression

In the second module, I focused on how to predict numbers, like the price of a car, using regression models. I applied what I learned with a project about estimating car prices.

### Main Things I Learned
- How to prepare data and find useful patterns  
- How to create a simple model called linear regression and understand the basics behind it  
- How to check how accurate my predictions are using a thing called RMSE (a way to measure errors)  
- How to improve my models by adding new features and fixing mistakes  
- Why regularization helps in making better models that work well on new data  
- How to test and tune my models to make them as good as possible  
- Building models in Python from scratch and also using helpful libraries  

> This part showed me that building good models isn’t just about coding , it’s about understanding the data and making small improvements step by step.
